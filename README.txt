Introduction
============

If you need to create a browser view with configuration this add-on will make life easier.


Features:

* Configuration datastore (annotation)
* Configuration structure defined throw zope.interface & zope.schema
* AutoForm to manage settings

Why doing this in an add-on
===========================

Because most of the time developers faced to this issue store data in the content type and I want to respect MVC.
